sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

And fill in the following lines at the end of that file

# IPv6 disabled
net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

Save the file and close it. Restart sysctl with

$ sudo sysctl -p


Also added to blacklist (used below, but used nano instead)

echo 'blacklist ipv6' | sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.local' >/dev/null
