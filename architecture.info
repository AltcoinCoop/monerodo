Monerodo Architecture Information

As of 0.1, the software is not engineered with many fault tolerances. I.e., if you don't have the expected user behavior, the software will not have
the expected software behavior. These can all be eventually addressed.

Currently the Monerodo OS assumes that all of the daemons are already installed, as this OS is meant to be the front end for the Monerodo, a hardware
device that runs a full monero node and mining pool. Thus, the scripts are made to modify existing software, not add it. A full Monerodo creation
script can be developed.
