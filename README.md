# monerodo
A repository for scripts to update and manage a monerodo

The scripts here are designed to operated in a system where the daemons have already been installed - specifically, a Monerodo device.
The system can be reverse engineered to make these scripts work. And at some point I will make a Monerodo conversion script (turn any
device into a monerodo).
